ECG Circuit and Troubleshooting : 3/8/21
========================================

The interface between the patient being monitored and the analog 
front end (AFE) circuitry is the electrode. The electrode is of 
paramount importance in ensuring adeauate signal reception for the 
AFE. I have spent so much time trying to debug my ECg circuit only to 
realize that the electrodes were too dry or defective. I have lost 
countless hours trying to determine why I wasn't getting a proper 
signal; I was checking voltages, resitor values, lead placement, 
grounding, and the power supply, only to finally realize that the 
electrodes were the source of all my troubles. Going forward, 
electrode difficulties should be checked first when debugging an ECG 
circuit.
